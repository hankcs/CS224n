def softmax(x):
    """
    Compute the softmax function in tensorflow.

    You might find the tensorflow functions tf.exp, tf.reduce_max,
    tf.reduce_sum, tf.expand_dims useful. (Many solutions are possible, so you may
    not need to use all of these functions). Recall also that many common
    tensorflow operations are sugared (e.g. x * y does a tensor multiplication
    if x and y are both tensors). Make sure to implement the numerical stability
    fixes as in the previous homework!

    Args:
        x:   tf.Tensor with shape (n_samples, n_features). Note feature vectors are
                  represented by row-vectors. (For simplicity, no need to handle 1-d
                  input as in the previous homework)
    Returns:
        out: tf.Tensor with shape (n_sample, n_features). You need to construct this
                  tensor in this problem.

def cross_entropy_loss(y, yhat):
    """
    Compute the cross entropy loss in tensorflow.
    The loss should be summed over the current minibatch.

    y is a one-hot tensor of shape (n_samples, n_classes) and yhat is a tensor
    of shape (n_samples, n_classes). y should be of dtype tf.int32, and yhat should
    be of dtype tf.float32.

    The functions tf.to_float, tf.reduce_sum, and tf.log might prove useful. (Many
    solutions are possible, so you may not need to use all of these functions).

    Note: You are NOT allowed to use the tensorflow built-in cross-entropy
                functions.

    Args:
        y:    tf.Tensor with shape (n_samples, n_classes). One-hot encoded.
        yhat: tf.Tensorwith shape (n_sample, n_classes). Each row encodes a
                    probability distribution and should sum to 1.
    Returns:
